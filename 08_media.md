# Media coverage

Within a few weeks, thousands of researchers from over 120 countries around the globe have visited our website making use of the directory and contributing to the growing number of entries.

We are working with authors of policy trackers to propose concrete actions to solve information gaps in existing policy trackers and create synergies between them. At the same time, their feedback has informed the creation of the Supertracker.

> *“The Oxford Supertracker offers a precious compass to help policymakers, practitioners and researchers to navigating the rich and evolving set of trackers available globally.”* <br/>
**Ugo Gentilini**, Global lead for social assistance, World Bank

> *“The Supertracker is a rich repository of different to COVID-related policy trackers, immensely useful to policymakers and researchers and beyond, who wish to better understand the implications of COVID.”* <br/>

**Ian Orton**, Social Protection Policy Officer, International Labour Organization

> *“The team behind the Oxford Supertracker have done an impressive job in assembling the rapidly growing data on countries’ COVID responses and in making them readily available and easily searchable. This is an enormous service to the research and policy community, including many colleagues here at the OECD.”* <br/>
**Sebastian Königs** and **Andrea Garnero**, Economists, OECD

# Oxford Supertracker

The Oxford Supertracker is a global directory of over 100 COVID related **[policy trackers](policy-trackers/)** and **[surveys](surveys/)**. This novel collection is designed to assist researchers and policy-makers in keeping track of the rapidly growing number of data sources. You can search for the datasets of your interest to identify the relevant information across different areas, countries and data types.

If you would like to receive updates on new sources that we include continuously, you can **[subscribe here for updates](subscribe/)**.

The Oxford Supertracker is a collaborative effort. Over 50 persons have already contributed to the growing collection. If you maintain or know of an additional dataset, please **[submit a new source](submit-a-tracker/)**. We will promptly review if it falls into the **[criteria for inclusion](documentation/)** and update the collection.

We are interest in making the collection as comprehensive and accessible as possible. If you have any ideas, please **[share your feedback](Contact/)**.

# Analysis

The novel cross-country sources on policies provide a range of new opportunities as well as challenges for research and policy analysis. We are discussing these in our **[blog series](blog/)**. Please contact us in case you would like to **[contribute to the debate](Contact/)**.

We are also partnering up with the producers and users of existing data sources on social policies in the wake of the pandemic to identify remaining information gaps and potential synergies, and to propose concrete actions to address these. A webinar discussion and policy brief will address information gaps in existing policy trackers. You can find more information on the Supertracker project on the website of the **[Department of Social Policy and Intervention at the University of Oxford][DSPI]**.

# Oxford Supertracker

The Oxford Supertracker is a global directory of over 100 **[policy trackers](policy-trackers/)** and **[surveys](surveys/)** related to COVID-19. This novel collection is designed to assist researchers and policy-makers in keeping track of a rapidly growing number of data sources. You can search and identify  relevant information resources (datasets, surveys, and other systematic collections) across different areas, countries and data types.

If you would like to receive updates on new sources, you can **[subscribe here](subscribe/)**.

The Oxford Supertracker is a collaborative effort. Over 50 people have already contributed to the growing collection. If you maintain or know of an additional dataset, please **[submit a new source](submit-a-tracker/)**. We will promptly review it in line with our **[criteria for inclusion](documentation/)** and update the collection.

We are interested in making the collection as comprehensive and accessible as possible. If you have any suggestions for improvements, please **[share your feedback](submit-feedback/)**.

# Analysis

The appearance of many new information resources on COVID-19 creates opportunities and challenges for research and policy analysis. We discuss these in our **[blog series](blog/)**. Please contact us in case you would like to **[contribute to the debate](submit-feedback/)**.

We are also partnering up with the producers and users of existing data sources on social policies in the wake of the pandemic to identify remaining information gaps and potential synergies, and to propose concrete actions to address these. A webinar discussion and policy brief will address information gaps in existing policy trackers. You can find more information on the Supertracker project on the website of the **[Department of Social Policy and Intervention at the University of Oxford][DSPI]**.

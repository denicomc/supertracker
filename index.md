# Oxford Supertracker

To keep track of policy trackers, surveys and new datasets, the Oxford Supertracker compiles a collection of over 100 new sources related to COVID-19. The idea is to create a single directory for researchers and policy-makers to find the relevant information and data sources across different areas and countries.

Search for policy trackers and relevant data sources using our **[database of policy trackers](data/)**.

The criteria for inclusion into the supertracker are explained in the **[documentation](documentation/)**.

The Oxford Supertracker is a living collection and over 50 persons have contributed with their suggestions to the collection. We are updating the tracker of trackers on a regular basis. Please submit your feedback or suggestion for new sources via this **[form](submit-a-tracker/)**.

# Analysis of data sources

We are partnering up with the producers and users of existing data sources on COVID-19 social policy to identify important informational gaps and potential synergies and to propose concrete actions to address these. A webinar discussion and policy brief will address information gaps in existing policy trackers. Please find more information on the Supertracker project on the website of the **[Department of Social Policy and Intervention at the University of Oxford][DSPI]**.

As part of our data review, we will provide a series of **[blogs](blogs/)** on new opportunities for research arising from the novel sources. We also address remaining information gaps and suggest areas for further data collection and use of synergies.

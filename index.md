To keep track of new policy trackers and data sources, the **Oxford Supertracker** compiles a collection of currently over 100 policy trackers and datasets related to COVID-19. The idea is to establish a single directory for researchers and policy-makers to find the relevant information sources across different areas. We are currently working on adding additional functionalities and tools for data exploration. 

# Database of Policy Trackers

Search for policy trackers and relevant data sources using our **[database of policy trackers](data/)**.

# Documentation

The criteria for inclusion into the supertracker are explained in the **[documentaion](documentation/)**.

# Suggest new sources

The Oxford Supertracker is a living collection and over 50 persons have contributed with their suggestions to the collection. We are updating the tracker of trackers on a regular basis. Please submit your feedback or suggestion for new sources via this **[form](contact/)**.

# Analysis of data sources

We are partnering up with the producers and users of existing data sources on COVID-19 social policy to identify important informational gaps and potential synergies and to propose concrete actions to address these. A webinar discussion and policy brief will address information gaps in existing policy trackers. Please find more information on the project on the website of the **[Department of Social Policy and Intervention at the University of Oxford][DSPI]**.

As part of our review of new data sources, we provide a series of **[blogs](blog/)** on the new opportunities for research arising from the novel sources and remaining information gaps. We also suggest areas for further data collection and use of synergies.
